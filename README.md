# class-notes
A repo for students to share their notes on class materials!

Raluca great initiative inspired me to create this repo for you guys :) 

## HOUSE RULES

(The organisation of this will be optimised and adapted over time. I have created a directory structure aligned with our curriculum modules. Please suggest any improvements you can think of, by creating issues and pull requests to resolve any issues). My starter suggestions would be:

**Note file naming convention:**  
 * \<topic-name>_DD_MM_YYYY.\<extension>
 * i.e., variables-are-like-boxes_01_10_2020.css

**This repo belongs to you and your classmates, do your bit to make it a cool space :)**

## a note on the .gitkeep files

Each directory in this repo has been initialised with an empty **.gitkeep** file in order to have git track the module/sub-module organisation. *The .gitkeep file in each subdirectory can and should be systematically deleted once the subdirectory contains other files (and is thus tracked by git).
